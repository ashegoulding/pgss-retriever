# Compass Group PGSS Payslip Retriever
This is a Python script that retrieves your pay slips from Compass Group's PGSS
website and sends to your email. I wrote this script so I don't have to log onto
the stupid site every time I want to get my pay slips. What a stupid way to do
things.

I could've just filed an OFI to tell them to just email all the pay slips just
like any other normal companies do. Yup, that's gonna work because Compass Group
is more than capable of doing that.

Well, sack me then.
